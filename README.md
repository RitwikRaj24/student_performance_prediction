### Title: 
Predictive Student Score Analysis with 
Modular Coding and CI/CD Pipeline

#### Summary:
Our project aims to develop a robust predictive model 
for student academic performance leveraging machine 
learning techniques. This endeavor incorporates two key 
components: modular coding and a continuous integration and 
continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.
